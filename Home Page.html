    <h1>Digital & Physical Media Preservation - Jacob Mosden </h1>
    <p>The only difference between archaeology and grave robbing is time. While not a concrete claim, there is some truth to it if we really think about it. That being said, how much time is enough? And what is the difference between a games preservationist and a pirate?<br><br>
As a college student without an infinite game library, 15 consoles, and some morality. I would argue that anything 1-2 generations behind is fair game, Nintendo's lawyers would beg to differ. In recent years, this hot topic has sparked a lot of debate, and I personally hate the idea that there may come a time when people cant enjoy the things I hold dear to me (everyone must love the same things I do). Over the last 5 years, I've gotten into games preservation in an attempt to make experiences people love, last forever.<br><br>
Ownership shouldn't be finite, if a consumer pays for a product, I firmly believe that they have the right to do whatever they want with it (so long as they aren't openly redistributing a game that is currently for sale). For most of gaming history, this has been the case. If you own a copy of the bee movie video game, you can make as many copies as you want of it, and you can even legally digitize it if you so choose.<br><br>
In the upcoming spring semester here at UAlbany this digitization and emulation will be my main job as an intern for Mr. Clow. Helping to bring games (old and new) to the hands of more UA students. A lot of times, getting our hands on the original hardware can be costly, and it is prone to breaking (Look up Xbox360 red ring of death). This begs the question, how can we legally bring these experiences to the hands of students in a cheap, accessible, reliable, and authentic way? <br><br>
 An emulator is a piece of hardware or software that pretends to be another (emulating its actions) to allow a task to be completed (usually running an application)  on nonnative hardware. In this case, we can use the example of the Dolphin emulator. Dolphin pretends to be a Nintendo Wii, allowing a user to upload their own game collection to their device and run each of them on a different machine. In my case I have run dolphin on laptops, mini PC's and Desktops, and those are likely the environments I will be running it on in the library.<br><br>

   <h1>How Do We LEGALLY Acquire The Games?</h1>

   <p>The most common form of media acquisition is purchase (in the modern age this isn't necessarily true due to DRM and digitization, we will touch on that later), however, every game ranges in availability, especially for consoles that are almost 20 years old. And if we are attempting to create a catalogue that encapsulates and fairly represents many consoles (new and old), we are looking at hundreds or even thousands of unique games. 
    If we assume we have even 5000 games, and we buy each for $10, we would loose our funding very quickly…. On top of this, space is limited, and if we had 3 single files lines of games (for 5000 games), each would take up over 23 meters (yes I did and checked the math on 14mm thick cases). If we are able to digitize each game, we can solve the size issue (replacing it with a digital storage issue). Most of these games are available online for free, however, we cannot as a university endorse piracy (its unprofessional and illegal or something), thus, we must solve our issue of getting said games legally (as this section is titled). This is where some of my research and thinking comes in handy, so of my ideas are as follows:
   </p>



   <ol>
  <li>Phone-book method: we have students bring us their games, we digitally clone them and keep the students information proving that we dumped the game ourself. With this we will have said student sign a paper stating that they agree to not play the game at the same time we are using it.</li><br>
  <li>Buy the cheap ones: We try to make our collection by buying all the cheap games! This saves money, and gives us full ownership of the games.</li><br>
  <li>Donation: We ask people to just give us their games that they don't want anymore, in exchange, we will allow them to mark it as a charitable donation on their taxes.</li><br>
</ol>

  <p>The 3 methods stated above have their own flaws, 1 is unenforceable and we can make it clear to the students that we know that. this allows us to not have to store the physical game, and pass the blame off to the student if we get caught (or it happens to be illegal, ill do more research on this during the actual internship). 2 is a good idea, but it leaves us with second hand games that people don't want, or can be found super easily. Sure we may find some good games every once in a while, but there is no guarantee that we will ever find something good. 3 is an organizational nightmare. We need to find an approximate value for the games and the tax deduction, we need to store every game, and we need to make sure we don't get duplicates of games (or have a way of dealing with them), and catalogue everything. <br><br>
As of right now, I don't have a catchall method that would ensure 100% success or even one that I can call the “best”, however, a combination of all of these is needed. A method where we can legally dispose of the games after we digitize them, pay for as few as possible, get as few duplicates as possible, and ensure that everything we are doing is legal. <br><br>
I look forward to everyone being able to see the progress that we make next semester, and I cant wait to see what the library has in store for me!<br><br>
