    <H2>Watch Dogs 2</H2>
<p>The second game in the Watch Dogs franchise, developed by Ubisoft Montreal and arguably the best game in the series. We are shown a dystopian 
  (not so far off) future, where the entire country is controlled and constantly monitored by an AI surveillance system. It's like GTA, but less grinding and it
  has a better story overall. The characters are fun to hang around, and the skill tree system makes every playthrough unique. I will say, if you want to get into
  this series, play Watch Dogs 1 first, then play the second. There is no need to play legion unless it is free, super cheap or you want to feel completely milked
  by a company who didn't know where to take a successful franchise<br><br><br><br><br>

<h2> IdleOn</h2>
<p> Have you ever wanted to waste hundreds of hours of your life? Have you ever said "I need another MMORPG" in my life? Have you ever... uhhh, wanted to
  just play an idle game that never ends. Well, IdleOn is the game for you! You take control of a small player and do monotonous tasks while min-maxing everything.
  You can make up to 10 different characters (as of right now), with 3 classes to choose from, with 2 branching paths each. I've played for about 4 years now (on and off)
  I constantly regret spending as much time on the game as I do, however, if you need a time waster for a few minutes to hours at a time, it's the game for you! (It
  also makes a great screensaver)<br><br><br><br><br>

  <H2>Vampire Survivors</H2>
  <p>
    Do you hate bullet hells? If so, this is not the game for you. VS is a rogue-lite where everything you do matters. The rounds last 15-30 minutes depending on
    the mode, and you can fully customize your build to suite your needs. <br><br><br><br><br>

    <H2>Minecraft</H2>
    <p>
      I will not be explaining what Minecraft is. I am far too old and the game is too popular for me to have to explain it, nor will I be providing a link for the game.<br><br><br><br><br>
