    <h1>Jacob Mosden - A website </h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Jacob (yes thats me to the right), and this is my website. This page has been created for my CYBR201 class here at UA where I am currently a Sophomore.   This final came with the guidelines of "Teach me something", and thats what I shall do! As of right now, I have 2 internships lined up, one of which is with a large japanese semiconductor manufacturer who will be sending me to Texas this summer (YEEEE HAWWWWW)! However, the second more recent opportunity is what I want to focus on more for this project. If there is anything I love in this world, its my family, friends, food, and games preservation. This upcoming semester I have the wonderful opportunity to work with the University Library in a major games preservation project, where I will be combining knowledge of right to repair, preservation, and potentially programming and cybersecurity, in order to widen the Universities media library. This is the main reason I have chosen to make this website about media preservation. 
    </p>
